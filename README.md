# HPV Diagnosis Study: Excel-Based Statistical Analysis

This repository contains an Excel-driven analysis of HPV diagnosis using cytology and PCR results across different age groups. All data manipulation, statistical testing, and visualizations were performed using Microsoft Excel.

## 📊 Study Focus

- **Objective**: To assess the correlation between cytological findings and HPV PCR results
- **Scope**: 500 individuals across age ranges 20–45
- **Tools Used**: Excel formulas, pivot tables, charts, T.TEST, CHISQ.TEST

## 📁 Contents

- `excel/`: Contains raw data, manipulated datasets, and statistical test sheets
- `visuals/`: Graphs generated from Excel (bar, line, pie)
- `results/`: Summary of findings and interpretations
- `LICENSE`: MIT license for open-source sharing

## 📈 Key Results

- **T-Test (20–25 vs 41–45)**: p = 0.000581 → Significant difference in positivity rates
- **Chi-Square Test**: p = 0.00001 → Strong association between age and HPV positivity
- **Trend**: Positivity rate increases steadily from 0.25 to 0.45 across age brackets

## 📌 Conclusion

Excel proved to be a powerful tool for clinical data analysis. The study supports the integration of HPV PCR into routine screening, especially for older age groups where cytology may under-detect infections.
